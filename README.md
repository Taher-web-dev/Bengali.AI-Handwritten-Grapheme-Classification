# Bengali.AI-Handwritten-Grapheme-Classification
Kaggle competition which intend to accelerate Bengali handwritten optical character recognition:  Public accuracy=0.951  Private accuracy=0.889
For this competition, we are given the image of a handwritten Bengali grapheme and are challenged to separately classify three constituent elements in the image: grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics.  
So we will find in this repistory the following files:
<b> Great starter!: </b>This file encomapses the preprocessing datas step, data visualisation and first trial with a cnn algorithm.  
<b> Bengali handwritten grapheme classification:</b> In this file, we had had fine-tunned the cnn algorithm, used in the first file. We had obtained an accuracy grower than 95%.
